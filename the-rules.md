In _Horrea_, players compete to become the most prestigious Roman by having their agents engage in trade in markets across the Roman Empire. In each turn, agents are set out one step at a time across the network of markets to establish horrea (warehouses) or destroy other players' horrea, negotiate alliances or break them apart, establish a presence in a region or prevent another agent from accessing it.

Trade functions through every market where a player has established a warehouse. The further from Rome, the higher the transport and information costs and the lower the profit. But agents who are connected back to Rome are better informed, and so can get a better return. At the edges of Empire fortunes can be made accessing the wealth of the East, the South, or the North!

Money is not the only way for a player to grow in prestige; a combination of clever board control and alliances and benefactions allow a player to move up the cursus honorum (prestige ladder) to become Consul! But fate will always play a role, and can upset the most intricate of plans.


# Rules of _Horrea_

## Aim of the Game
Become the most prestigious Roman through trade and treachery!

- First person to 15 prestige points wins the consulship, and the game.

## Game Set Up

- for 3 to 4 players
- everyone has $200 to start
- place each player's money counter on the money ladder.
- shuffle then deal everyone 3 family cards (family cards are 'boy', 'girl')
- shuffle the fate cards and place face down on the board
- prestige for everyone at the start is 0. 
- Place prestige counters on the prestige ladder on the board.
- Players may only go into debt, if necessary, in any phase, if they have more than 0 prestige; players may borrow money at the rate of $100 per 1 prestige point.
- roll the dice to determine who will play first. Highest roll wins; play proceeds clockwise.
- each player has four agent tokens; each player places one token on Rome.

## Order of Play
- the game is played in a series of turns; each turn has a sequence of distinct phases. Each phase is completed in turn. 
- the phases within a turn are:
- Move Agents
- Social Intrigues
- Trade
- Build
- Draw fate card
- Convert money into prestige
- Victory conditions are assessed at the end of the turn if necessary.

If player 'Alice' starts the turn, Alice is the first person to do each phase _within_ that turn. All players complete a phase before the next phase begins. Thus, Alice starts, then Alice moves, then Bob, then Charlie. Then Alice does the next phase ('Social Intrigue'), then Bob, then Charlie, and so on. 

The next turn 'Bob' starts, and then Bob is the first person to do each phase within that turn. Thus, Bob moves his agents, then Charlie, then Alice. 

## Phases of Play

### Movement Phase ###

- each player has the opportunity at the start of each movment phase to put one more agent on the board. This is accomplished by a roll of the die of 4 or higher. A new agent is placed on Rome and may be used this turn, and be moved.

- a player may not have more than one agent on Rome, and so an agent must be moved to an adjacent market as part of the 1 move of that agent.

- agents can move once per turn as part of the movement phase.

- agents do not have to move if the player wishes.

- agents move 1 step over the network along the links to adjacent cities.

- IN ALL CITIES except for Rome, there can only be ONE agent. 
HOWEVER:
- a player can still move her agent to a market where there is another player's agent, but this situation MUST be resolved during the 'Social Intrigues' phase.

### Social Intrigues Phase ###

- There are THREE kinds of social manouevres that players can engage in:
+ MARRIAGE ALLIANCE with another player
+ MARRIAGE ALLIANCE into the local aristocracy of a market
+ OUSTING of Agents in a given market

** Marriage alliance with another player **

-  a player can propose a marriage alliance during that player's social intrigues phase, to any other player.
- both players must have an eligible family card of different gender, e.g, one has a boy, the other has a girl.
- the two players negotiate a price that the player who initiates the proposal has to pay to the other player.
- if accepted, both players get +2 prestige
- both family cards are removed from play
- marriages can be dissolved 
- through an appropriate FATE card
- through aggressive action by one player in the alliance towards the other (OUSTING an agent or DESTROYING a horrea)
- at the request of one of the players
- if a marriage is dissolved BOTH players LOSE 2 Prestige in all cases, and the initial price MUST be repayed.

-ADVANTAGES of Marriage Alliance with another player
- the presence of one player's agent on the other player's horreum (warehouse) in the TRADE phase acts as if it were second player's agent as well. 

** Marriage alliance into the local aristocracy of a market **

- a player can marry into the 'local aristocracy' of a market on which she has an agent when:
- the player has an elgible family card (e.g, a boy or girl card)
- the player can pay $200
- no other player has already married into that market's aristocracy
- the player's prestige increases +1 prestige
- the family card is removed from play
- the marriage can be dissolved
- through an appropriate FATE card

-ADVANTAGES of Marriage Alliance with Local Aristocracy
- a roll to OUST the player's agent from that market has to be 6.
- the allied player can OUST other players from that market with a roll of 2 or higher.
- the allied player can DESTROY another player's horreum on the market with a roll of 2 or higher

** OUSTING A PlAYER'S AGENT **

- BECAUSE no market other than Rome can have more than one agent on it by the end of a turn:
- a player must oust another player's agent when both players are on the same market
- the player who was the SECOND to move in the market MUST initiate the ousting procedure

- ousting does not affect horrea.
- being ousted DOES NOT dissolve a marriage alliance with the local aristocracy

- the OUSTING player pays $200
- the OUSTING player must roll 4+
- if the OUSTING player has a marriage alliance into the local aristocracy, the roll is 2+ to remove the other player
- if the defending player has a marriage alliance into the local aristocracy, the roll must be 6
- the losing player's agent is removed from the board (and can be reintroduced during the move phase on a 4+ roll)

### Trade Phase ###

- the returns on trade depend on distance from Rome and informational uncertainty
- the return in any one market also depends on the number of horrea exploiting that market; more horrea lower the profit per player
- players count up the value for each market they have a horrea in
- each market indicates the value available depending on number of horrea in it - see Figure xx
- WHEN a player has an agent IN ROME and in a market with horrea in BOTH cities, informational uncertainty is REMOVED and the player receives the FULL VALUE of that market: 
- for a major market, the FULL value returned is $240
- for a medium market, the FULL value retured is $180
- for a minor market, the FULL value is $120

- If by the trade phase a player has a FULL NETWORK PATH from ROME to another LARGE market (ie a horreum in each market on any path of five steps starting in Rome and ending in the large market): the player recieves the FULL value (ie $240) for the large market without having to have an agent present.

- players keep track of their money by moving their token along the money ladder on the board

### Build Phase ###
- a player may only BUILD or DESTROY during this phase
- a market may only have one horreum per player
- FINALLY, a player may, after BUILD or DESTROY, do ONE BENEFACTION during this phase

** BUILD **
- a player may only build one horreum per market
- a player must have an agent on that market in order to build there 
- a player may only build one horreum per turn
- the player must pay $100 to build
- the player receives + 1 prestige for that player's FIRST horreum in a region
- the player receives + 1 prestige for each FIVE horrea of that player in a region
- if the player puts a horrea in EVERY market in a region that player receives + 2 prestige

** DESTROY **
- a player may choose to DESTROY another player's horreum in a market
- the player must pay $200
- the player must roll 4+. If successful, the other player's horreum is removed
- IF the defending player is married into the local aristocracy at that market, the roll must be 6+
- IF the attacking player is married into the local aristocracy at that market, the roll must be 2+.

** BENEFACTIONS **
- for each band on the PRESTIGE ladder (Quaestor, Aedile, Praetor) there are three possible benefactions you may give.
- benefactions in the QUAESTOR band cost $200 to give
- benefactions in the AEDILE band cost $500 to give
- benefactions in the PRAETOR band cost $1000 to give

- a player can only give one benefaction per turn
- a player places one of her horrea tokens on the benefaction's space on the ladder to indicate that it has been given and that no other player may give that benefection.
- a player may only give benefactions for the band in which their prestige currently applies, e.g, a player with prestige of 4 may only give benefactions in the QUAESTOR band. If all the benefactions in that band have already been given, that player may not give a benefaction at all until their presitge level allows them to reach the next band.

- giving a benefaction results in prestige +1.

### DRAW FATE CARD ###

The player who began the TURN draws a fate card and reads it to the players. All players take whatever actions or consequences that the fate card specifies. The fate card is then discarded.


### CONVERT MONEY INTO PRESTIGE ###

At this point in the TURN, 

- when a player's available money INCREASES past a multiple of $1000 mark as a result of the current turn's events, the player EARNS 1 prestige.
- when a player's available money DECREASES past a multiple of $1000 mark as a result of the current turn's events, the player LOSES 1 prestige.
- if a player needs to go into DEBT at any PHASE of a turn, the player loses 1 prestige per $100. 
- Prestige cannot go below 0.


### ASSESS VICTORY ###

Victory occurs IF a player has achieved 15 prestige points at the END of a turn, after all players have finished the previous phase.

- If two or more players achieved 15 prestige points at the same time, the winner is the player with the most money.

- If there should happen to be a tie in both prestige and money, the winner is the player who gave the most benefactions.
