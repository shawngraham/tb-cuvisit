## Public Knowledge:

- debt
- money ladder
- prestige ladder
  - cursus honorem & the kinds of benefactions available at different levels and what they mean
  - various gifts at various levels get exhausted: idea of what is appropriate to give, under the emperor

## Stochastic:
- shuffle fate cards
- why fate cards
- roll the dice to determine who goes first
- roll die to intro new agents
- fate cards that promote marriage or divorce: historical precedents
- rolling 4+ to oust to make it harder
- reducing rolling to 2+ in event of attacker having local marriage alliance
- increasing rolling to 6 in event defender has local marriage alliance (these might be better handled under playability)

## Agency:
- four agents
- entry of new agents
- ousting of agents: this should probably be crosslinked to justification:info and justification: market info, re protectionism etc, limiting information available which is key to Bang's hypothesis
- aggressive actions against another player and how we've modeled those, ie ousting and destroying warehouses and how that maps onto various hypotheses and historical excuses
- rolling to oust someone, and how the required roll depends on local marriage alliance
- losing player in ousting procedure removed from the board (is this better under playability or information reduction?)
- an agent has to be present in a market to achieve anything there.
- player choice to destroy something

## Geography:
- markets and network structure of links
- returns on trade depend on distance from Rome
- paths 1-2-3-4-5

## Rome:
- Rome as starting point
- new agent enters in Rome

## Time:
- turns & phases
- movement of one link per agent per turn
- build or destroy or give: all of these would take many years in real-time;

## Playability:
- victory conditions assessed at end of turn
- one agent per market
- second player onto a market has to be initiator
- cost to initiate an ousting procedure: to make it harder in the opening, to force players to spread out

## Prestige:

- be the most prestigious roman
- first warehouse; five warehouses; every market in a region; prestige boosts: mogul effect
- prestige and various levels of the cursus honorem; cost relationships, costly signalling theories
- relationship of money and prestige, games of seeing and being seen; ideologies of consumption under rome.

## market Economy
- number of agents per market
- warehouses and what they stand for in the game versus functioning in the past (see basilica, horrea, rome & ostia, collegia etc)
- return depends on number of warehouses exploiting that market
- nodes are small, big, and exotic markets rather than cities. and why that is the case.
- one warehouse per market per player
- cost of building - acknowledging there is a cost, (number largely arbitrary here, no mimensis), that there is social signalling in construction (see Delaine's Baths of Caracalla), and that construction can equal prestige; thus why x number of warehouses translates to prestige in this game
- destroying a warehouse: analog under market conditions - bang's traders colluding to deny competition perhaps?

## social
- limited number of social manouevres modelled
- marriage alliance with another player
- marriage alliance with local aristocracy: why this works
- family structure, and limiting to boy and girl
- negotiating dowry between players
- marriage and its links to prestige mechanisms in roman society
- divorce and when it is socially costly
- local aristocracy marriage (and flat rate dowry payment in this case)
- prestige in/via a local market


## info
- when you're married to another player, their agent acts in your interest too
- returns on trade depend on informational uncertainty
- agent in rome and in other market with warehouses in both (so two agents, two warehouses, two markets), info uncertainty is removed
-reducing trade

## benefactions
- why benefactions are a feature of the game: a mechanism for translating wealth into prestige, demonstrating fitness for rule, euergetism
