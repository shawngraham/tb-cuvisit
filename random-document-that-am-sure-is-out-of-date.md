To set up:
Place each player's money counter on the money ladder at $200;
Place each player's prestige counter on the cursus honorum ladder at 0;
Place one agent token per player on Rome;
Shuffle then deal everyone 3 family cards;
Shuffle the fate cards and place them face down on the board;
Roll the dice to determine who will play first. Highest roll wins; play proceeds clockwise.
To play:
The game is played in a series of turns; each turn has a sequence of distinct phases. In each phase all players performs their actions in a clockwise order. In the next turn the starting player is the one to the left of the player who started the previous turn.
In each phase players may perform only ONE action. The phases within a turn are:
Move Agents
Each player can put one of the remaining agents on Rome if they roll 4 or higher. Every agent can (but does not have to) move 1 step over the network along the links to adjacent cities. If an agent finds themselves on a market already occupied by another agent the ‘ousting’ procedure has to be invoked in the ‘social intrigues’ phase. This does not apply to Rome where each player can have ONE agent.
Social Intrigues
Each player may only do one social intrigue per turn.
** OUSTING of an agent **
If two agents find themselves on one market the agent who arrived second pays $200 and rolls the die. If none of the players are married into the local aristocracy (see below) and the result is 4 or more the defending agent is removed from the board. If the result is 3 or less the attacking agent is removed from the board. Any horrea on that market are not affected.
** MARRIAGE ALLIANCE into the local aristocracy of a market **
A player can marry one of their children (family cards) with the aristocracy on a market where one of their agents is present. To do so, the player has to pay $200 and discard one of the family cards.
ADVANTAGES of Marriage Alliance with Local Aristocracy
a roll to OUST the player's agent from that market or DESTROY their horreum has to be 6;
the player can OUST other players from that market or DESTROY their horrea with a roll of 2 or higher;
+1 to prestige.
** MARRIAGE ALLIANCE with another player **
A player can marry one of their children (family cards) with a child of another player. To do so, the proposing player has to pay a price negotiated with the other player and both players have to discard a matching family card (one girl and one boy). A marriage can be dissolved at a request of each player or if one of the players performs an aggressive act (ousting or destruction of horreum). If a divorce happens each player loses 2 prestige points.
ADVANTAGES of Marriage Alliance with another player
In the TRADE phase each player’s agents acts as if they were second player's agents as well (i.e., they obtain the trade boost);
+2 to prestige for each player.

Trade
Each player counts up the profit for each market where they have a horreum and moves their money token accordingly. If more than one horreum is present on a market the total profit of the location is divided between them - the value that each player obtains is displayed on the board. When a player has an agent in Rome AND in a market with a horreum, informational uncertainty is removed and the player receives a boost to the profit: 1 - $25; 2 - $50; 3 - $75; 4 - $100, 5 - $125. If the player has a full UNINTERRUPTED trading route from Rome to an exotic market, that is a horreum in each market city on a network path between Rome and an exotic market the player receives the profit boost for the exotic market ONLY without having to have an agent present.
Build
Each player may only do one build action per turn.
** BUILD **
Each player can build one horreum per turn. The player must have an agent on that market and pay $100 to build. The player receives + 1 prestige for that player's FIRST horreum in a region; + 1 prestige for each FIVE horrea in a region and + 2 prestige if the player puts a horreum in EVERY market in a region.
** DESTROY **
Each player can build one horreum of another player per turn. The player must have an agent on that market, pay $200 to build and roll 4 or higher (unless any one of the concerned players is married into the local aristocracy - see above). If successful, the other player's horreum is removed.
** BENEFACTIONS **
Each player can make one benefaction per turn. The player can pay an amount indicated on the board and choose any of the still available benefactions within the band of the cursus honorum that he currently occupies. Once made, the player’s token is placed on the benefaction’s space to indicate that it cannot be repeated by another player. Making a benefaction gives +1 to prestige.
Draw fate card
The player who began the TURN draws a fate card and reads it to the players. All players take whatever actions or consequences that the fate card specifies. The fate card is then discarded.
Convert money into prestige
At this point in the turn any player whose fortune increased past a multiple of $1000 mark gains +1 to prestige. If the player’s money fell below a multiple of $1000 mark the player loses 1 prestige.
Each player can go into DEBT at any point of the game, the player pays 1 prestige per $100 they want to borrow. However, prestige cannot go below 0.
Assess if victory conditions are met
Victory occurs IF a player has achieved 15 prestige points at the END of a turn, after all players have finished the previous phase. If two or more players achieved 15 prestige points at the same time, the winner is the player with the most money. If there should happen to be a tie in both prestige and money, the winner is the player who gave the most benefactions.
