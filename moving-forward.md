## our endgame?

- game taken up by a 'proper' game publisher
- print-on-demand version of the game
- formal academic publication(s)
- kickstarter - to fund the artwork, production, marketing, website
- website for the game, regardless.
- talk to kevin ballestrini, TPG solution?
- let's talk to Darlene re funding?


## to do list
- prepare the game for digital sharing with testers  **high priority**
  - presentable board/map
  - presentable cards
  - clearly described rules
  - historical notes: justification for why things are the way they are
  - email our ideal testers, see if they're interested (Ulrich, Tim, TB's brothers?) (give em' 2 weeks for feedback)
  - DATE: end of this week: NOV 4 (send it by friday evening)
  - iza: writeup short-rules

- research kickstarter & best practices for boardgames **low priority**
  - things they raise money for
  - reward structures
  - feasibility
  - talk with KB & TPG re their experience

- prepare the board game pitch
  - target audience - likely size, market demand
  - financials

- journal re all this done by end of the month **medium priority**
  - Internet Archaeology (open access) - 'so we made a board game. here's the motivation. here's what we wanted to get across. here's how we did it. here's the damn game.' link in the ideas re ABM <- figure out which exact aspects we want. diffusion on a network, with social network over top? stupid AI with evolutionary? series of small toy models? with/without evolving ai? start with the orbis network? compare orbis network metrics with our game network (intuited as most useful). Put a strong emphasis on the role of formalization in this paper. Even stupid formalization is better than no formalization. our game making is formalizing w/ paper, pen, thinking through the consequences of our theories: same way as we'd do ABM. each playtest was an iteration of a simulation. rules that we were sure about, but then dropped out - lack of fitness - parts of the network that seem to be dead-ends, motivation for dropping stuff was always 'playability' <- what does playability actually imply, as far as the roman economy. goals of the game have changed. ie, prestige became the final marker of winning<- which means in economy? recount what drops out/in via playtests

  - Point of the argument for this article? comparative value of different kinds of formalization? interwined economy/social? historical outreach? value of play? how did we come to understand a certain ruleset, implement it, educate people, ludic layers, generative layers


  - 'Board Gaming as Analog Formalization in Digital Archaeology: When digital archaeology meets cardboard' ; where motherboard meets cardboard
  - part 1 description of the project <- incorporate main message (roman social/economic space, intertwingling of the same)
  - part 2 outreach & education: general message of the game (social networks deform physical networks, interdependence); all the small bits of information that create the setting (the ludic layer) - how we tried to codify it.
  - part 3 formalization - bringing 3 people to find a middle ground about what they thought re R. Empire; made us think through our internal conceptual models; formalism meets procedural rhetorics; to play the game is to internalize what we believe about the past. but unlike video games, if you don't agree with our rules, you can change them: so the boardgame teaches digital literacy & the importance of challenging the black box.
    - examples - evolution of the goals of the game; markets that are in/out, structure of the network - our intuitive network vs orbis network <-metrics

- developed a board game rather than a video game b/c the rules are *not* hidden, and can be challenged, and are more in keeping with open access & reproducibility

  - Open Archaeology (open access)
  - Public Archaeology (is this open access?)
  - Journal of Hybrid Pedagogy?
  - Journal of Interactive Technology & Pedagogy?

    - if we wrote about student engagement however, we'd need ethics board approval
