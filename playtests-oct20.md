1st play-test observations

- let every player have 1 agent to start (b/c Tom has still to get on to the board)
- debt perhaps to remove 1 prestige point for each turn?
- need to have the trade scoring table on the board
- if you are zero prestige, you can't go into debt; amount of debt dependnet on amount of prestige? some kind of scale
- euergetism: is the price too low?
- emporia: is the price too low?
  - build only 1 emporium per turn?
  - start $200, emporium costs $100?
  - have a sheet of paper, just list the income per city per turn

- max euergetism 1 temple, 1 game etc per turn - build in some kind of waiting period?
- some way of displacing other people's emporia? [instead of building an emporium, pay $ to get chance to remove emporia by super die roll]

Play test 2
- start w $200
- build 1 emporium per turn
- emporia cost $100
- instead of build, can destroy, cost $100 for chance to roll 4+ [but what historical dynamic does this mirror]
- start w 1 agent on the board (rather than the none of before)
- can only go into debt if you spend prestige (sliding scale on the board) (repaying debt does not return prestige)
- marrying local: only one player can be married into a local aristocracy at a city.

clarification on basic rules: need both an emporium & an agent in rome to get the rome bonus.

- ousting: two agents on a city: the newcomer tries to oust: have to roll 4+. if challenger wins, loser off the board. challenger loses, he goes back to where he came from.
  - challenge costs $100
  - if you happen to be challenging on a city where you're married into the local aristocracy, the roll is 2+

- marrying should cost more (200 - ups the stakes in the early game for what you decide to do)?
- you cannot have two of your agents on the same city. If that is the only option (as in Rome), then you must remove the agent.
