1st play-test observations

- let every player have 1 agent to start (b/c Tom has still to get on to the board)
- debt perhaps to remove 1 prestige point for each turn?
- need to have the trade scoring table on the board
- if you are zero prestige, you can't go into debt; amount of debt dependnet on amount of prestige? some kind of scale
- euergetism: is the price too low?
- emporia: is the price too low?
  - build only 1 emporium per turn?
  - start $200, emporium costs $100?
  - have a sheet of paper, just list the income per city per turn

- max euergetism 1 temple, 1 game etc per turn - build in some kind of waiting period?
- some way of displacing other people's emporia? [instead of building an emporium, pay $ to get chance to remove emporia by super die roll]

Play test 2
- start w $200
- build 1 emporium per turn
- emporia cost $100
- instead of build, can destroy someone elses, cost $100 for chance to roll 4+ [but what historical dynamic does this mirror]
- start w 1 agent on the board (rather than the none of before)
- can only go into debt if you spend prestige (sliding scale on the board) (repaying debt does not return prestige)
- marrying local: only one player can be married into a local aristocracy at a city.

clarification on basic rules: need both an emporium & an agent in rome to get the rome bonus.

- ousting: two agents on a city: the newcomer tries to oust: have to roll 4+. if challenger wins, loser off the board. challenger loses, he goes back to where he came from (if this is happening in rome, and he was just placed on the board, he leaves the board).
  - challenge costs $100
  - if you happen to be challenging on a city where you're married into the local aristocracy, the roll is 2+

- marrying should cost more (200 - ups the stakes in the early game for what you decide to do)?
- you cannot have two of your agents on the same city. If that is the only option (as in Rome), then you must remove the agent.


- play test # 3
- using rule changes from #2
- suggestion: euergetism 200. next temple has to be 300. next has to be 400 (competitive building!) prestige goes up by 1 each time.
- have a line for euergetism or prestige, some sort of visual marker showing off price of euergetism - does this intersect with the cursus honorem? see also the design on the game board.

- if you complete a trade route from rome to a city at distance 5, while that chain is complete, the number 5 city acts as if you have an agent on it.
- adoption: negotiated with another player. adoptee pays negotiated amount of money, gets +1 prestige; adopter gets the money. If the adoptee or adopter then moves agressively against the agent (oust) or the emporia (remove) then the bonds of family are broken and the aggressor loses +1 prestige. (have to have an adoption card available at the time to get adoption). if you're adopted you can be on same city with adoptee no problem. (same if you're married to the other player)

-major problem: earning prestige points later on, pathways to earning prestige, relationship between money & prestige? increase over $1000 = +1, over $2000 = +1, but if you drop under $1000, under $2000 you lose it again.
