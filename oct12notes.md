## Oct 12 notes - with edits

- main conceit is to make real the impact of physical & social networks on evolution of Roman economy
- 2nd century maximum extent of empire (? ibera a thing, gaul a thing, germania a thing, egypt, north africa, asia minor, achea, britannia etc - coarse grained)
- *goal* is to become wealthiest Roman by manipulating physical, social networks
- *board* stylized map of the Roman empire, with cities and trade routes(networks) prominent - coloured though not in radii but rather by bands of provinces
	- map is coloured with distance from Rome - further from Rome, greater cost/information uncertainty of movement, of price
- *cards* social cards with daughters, son, (for arranging marriage, adoption)
- *agents* pawns move around the board, representing the player's agents (an appropriate latin name for these: _negotiatores_?)
- *start* agents start in Rome; move along trade routes; 
	- agents generate not just physical control of space, but also social network (they distort prices in a given place because of their social connection to Rome)
	- agents can displace one another from a city
	- only a certain number of agents are available to the player (perhaps players can obtain more)
	- agents come into the game staggered, depending on something stochastic (ex of dutch game, peon)
- *prices* - social distance affects physical space and vice cersa
	- prices increase with distance from Rome (representing challenges of physical world, and informational uncertainty)
	- agents establish emporia/warehouses
	- warehouses/emporia _on their own_ enable simple trade
	- players use their agents in conjunction with warehouses/emporia in cities (which closes social distance between that city & Rome), thus reducing costs (ie, warehouse + agent gives you an edge there, better information, better price)

- *conflict* - happens when players displace one another
	- status in a place achieved by marrying into the local aristocracy (via the use of children cards;)
	- challenger takes a roll of the die to displace; 6 roll
	- only one agent can be in a town *unless* an existing alliance - forged between players by playing appropriate child card and payment of price
		- in which case allied players can both be in a town, but lowers accordingly what there is to exploit
- *trade* can happen with a warehouse/emporium; 
	- with agent + emporium, you get price improvement because of the social connection; 
	- with just the emporium, you get the local price

- *cities* distribution & value follows zipfs law
	- scoring equation:
		-basically two variables: (city: size[demand]) and (cost: distance from Rome, in network terms)
		- with emporium: size - cost = profit
		- with agent present: size = profit
			+ (or should it be size - cost/2 = profit? playtest!)
		- trade *must* have an emporium/warehouse
		- multiple emporia can exist in a town, but presence of multiple emporia lowers the price received for goods in that town [effect of multiple emporia is reduced by marriage, adoption]: price is divided by number of emporia

- *social complications* agents control cities; marriage or adoption allows two agents to control a city, get access to other warehouses in a province. Need appropriate cards for this to happen. Carries a cost.
	- in cases of marriage, divorce breaks the alliance; carries cost (daughter can't be remarried off; falls on her dagger)
	- adoptees can be disowned; carries cost.

- remember that Romans have a natural tendency towards oligopoly
- *order of play*
    + 1. everyone moves
    + 2. wheeling/deeling
    + 3. trade
    + 4. build emporia (can only use the money generated this turn to build)

Win conditions: most moneyâ€¦ [after time x? Control of board?]
