## Oct 12 notes

- main conceit is to make real the impact of physical & social networks on evolution of Roman economy
- *goal* is to become wealthiest Roman by manipulating physical, social networks
- *board* stylized map of the Roman empire, with cities and trade routes(networks) prominent
	- map is coloured with distance from Rome - further from Rome, greater cost/information uncertainty of movement, of price
- *cards* social cards with daughters, son, marriage, adoption
- *agents* pawns move around the board, representing the player's agents
- *start* agents start in Rome; move along trade routes; 
	- agents generate not just physical control of space, but also social network (they distort prices in a given place because of their social connection to Rome)
	- agents can displace one another from a city
	- only a certain number of agents are available to the player
- *prices* - social distance affects physical space and vice cersa
	- prices increase with distance from Rome (representing challenges of physical world)
	- players use their agents to establish warehouses/emporia in cities (which closes social distance between that city & Rome), thus reducing costs

- *conflict* - happens when players displace one another
	- takes a roll of the die; higher status individuals require higher rolls to displace
	- only one trader can be in a town *unless* an alliance - forged by playing appropriate combination of child card with marriage or adoption card, and payment of price
		- in which case allied players can both be in a town, but lowers accordingly what there is to exploit
- *trade* can happen with or without a warehouse/emporium; 
	- with agent + emporium, you get price improvement because of the social connection; 
	- with just the emporium, you get the local price

- *cities* distribution & value follows zipfs law
	- scoring equation:
		-basically two variables: (city: size[demand]) and (cost: distance from Rome, in network terms)
		- with emporium: size - cost = profit
		- with agent present: size = profit
		- trade *must* have an emporium/warehouse
		- multiple emporia can exist in a town, but presence of multiple emporia lowers the price received for goods in that down [effect of multiple emporia is reduced by marriage, adoption]

- *social complications* agents control cities; marriage or adoption allows two agents to control a city, get access to other warehouses in a province. Need appropriate cards for this to happen. Carries a cost.
	- in cases of marriage, divorce breaks the alliance; carries cost
	- adoptees can be disowned; carries cost.

- remember that Romans have a natural tendency towards oligopoly
- *order of play*
    + 1. everyone moves
    + 2. wheeling/deeling
    + 3. trade
    + 4. build emporia (can only use the money generated this turn to build)
Win conditions: most moneyâ€¦ [after time x? Control of board?]
