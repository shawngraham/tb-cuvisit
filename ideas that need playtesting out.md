# ideas that need playtesting out

## victory conditions

A - take money out of circulation, to put into "prestige"
	- some sort of exchange rate to buy victory points
		-> also can covert cars?
			(maybe automatically convert extra coin at end of turn?)

B - or x amount of HS, + agents in y # of major cities (define major?)

C - X number of rounds played
