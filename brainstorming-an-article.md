-1st part of message
  - we have ABM, struggle to communicate them, get people to engage w, critique, reproduce, challenge, existence
  - our way into boardgaming, drawing people into our simulation world

-2nd part of message
  - no coding skills? boardgames can give you feel for sim, the important rules nec'y for agency in the sim
  - see Analog Game Studies, vol 1, Will Emigh, [Strategies for Publishing Transformative Games](http://press.etc.cmu.edu/files/Analog-Game-Studies_Trammell-Torner-Waldron-etal-web.pdf)


- hypertext? affordances of [twine](http://twinery.org) - why this format, what's the point of controlling movement through the links rather than a plain old html doc with links
- controlling agency of the reader?

## random notes from around the picture of the ludic triangle in Shawn's orange notebook
+ Simulation: AI is the rules, AI is the player
+ Video games: AI is the rules, human is the player
+ Board games: human is the rule, human is the player
  - SG: this strikes me as an important aspect of all this project


- operationalization: reveals agenda
- we thought the social rules would be more critical during the playing, but this does not seem to be the case: is this a fail?
- ludic-triangle diagram gives a frame of reference for necissary literature, ideas, to explore, thresholds for criticisim
- 'playability' vs the modeler's 'operationalization'

- necessary literatures: on game based learning, pedagogy, wargaming & simulation,
